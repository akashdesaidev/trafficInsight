## 🎯 Cursor Integration Instructions

### How to Use This Plan with Cursor:

1. **Start each checkpoint** by copying the relevant section to Cursor
2. **Ask Cursor to implement** each task within the checkpoint
3. **Test each implementation** before marking complete
4. **Update checkpoint status** after testing:

   ```
   Update Checkpoint X.X status to:
   - [x] Completed
   - [x] Tested
   ```

5. **Request checkpoint review** from Cursor:

   ```
   "Review Checkpoint X.X implementation and suggest improvements"
   ```

6. **Move to next checkpoint** only after current one is tested

### Cursor Commands Template:

```
"Implement Checkpoint X.X: [Checkpoint Name]
- Create the required files
- Implement the listed tasks
- Add error handling
- Include basic tests"
```

### Testing with Cursor:

```
"Test Checkpoint X.X implementation:
- Verify all features work
- Check for edge cases
- Confirm performance requirements
- Update status if successful"
```
